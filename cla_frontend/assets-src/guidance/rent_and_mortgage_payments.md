In some cases, a client may be making payments on a mortgage and paying rent at the same time. 

##Rent to buy

If the client is in a "rent to buy" situation, they will be paying both mortgage payments and rent on the property they live in. You should enter both the mortgage and rent amounts into the means test.

##Two or more properties
If the client owns or rents two or more properties, you do not need to record the mortgage or rent payments for the second and subsequent homes. You must decide which is the main home and record the mortgage and/or rent for that property alone.

Please note: if the client's ex-partner and children live in the second home, you can record the rent or mortgage under 'Maintenance paid' if the client is meeting their housing costs.
