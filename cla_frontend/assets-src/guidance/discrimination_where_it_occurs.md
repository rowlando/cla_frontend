This article aims to help you answer the question: Where did the discrimination occur?
##Provision of services
The provision of services means the provision of goods or facilities to the public. It does not matter whether the services are provided free of charge (for example, access to a shopping mall) or in return for payment (for example, a meal in a restaurant). 
##Exercise of a public function
This covers a situation where any public authority or other person (including a private organisation) is carrying out a public function, where that function does not come under the services, work, premises or education provisions of the Equality Act 2010.

Examples include:
* a police officer carrying out a search as part of a criminal investigation
* a government department determining entitlements to benefits
* a prison officer receiving someone into a prison


##Association or private club
This covers any association or club if:
* it has 25 or more members
* admission as a member is regulated by rules and there is a selection procedure
* it is NOT a trade union or a professional organisation
