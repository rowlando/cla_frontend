Key questions to ask (sensitively to what the client has said) include: 

* do you think you have been singled out, or treated differently, or experienced worse treatment than someone else? If so, why? 

* do you think you have been disadvantaged in some way? If so, how? 

* do you think that rules, practices or ways of doing things have put you at a disadvantage? If so, how?

* did something happen to make you feel that you were in an environment that was intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive, or that violated your dignity? 

* do you think that what has happened to you is because you have previously complained of discrimination, brought a claim of discrimination, supported someone elseâ€™s claim or been suspected of doing one of these things? If so, why? 

* do you believe that you have been treated differently or experienced worse treatment because of something that arose out of your disability? If so, why?

* do you believe that you have been treated differently or experienced worse treatment because of something that is connected to your pregnancy or maternity leave? If so, why? 

* do you believe that any steps could have been taken to help you overcome any problems (ie accessing services, at work) that are linked to your disability? 

* where did the discrimination occur? 

* why do you think you were discriminated against?
