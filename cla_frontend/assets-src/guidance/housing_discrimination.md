For housing discrimination to apply, the client must live in rented accommodation. They must also have been treated less favourably than someone else by their landlord or social housing provider, due to a protected characteristic (for example, their race or sexual orientation).

One example of housing discrimination could be where a local authority has housed a disabled person in a property that is completely unsuited for a person with their disability.
